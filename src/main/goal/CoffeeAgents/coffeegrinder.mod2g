% The coffee grinder is a machine that is capable of grinding coffee beans into grounds.
% For making grounds it needs coffee beans (see imported coffee.pl). Whenever it needs
% beans it will request another machine it knows that can provide beans to provide those
% (see imported event.mod2g). It will learn this by asking all other agents what they can
% provide. The coffee grinder is very cooperative and will always provide what other
% machines need if it has what is requested for, or, alternatively, adopt a goal to make
% what is requested.

use coffee as knowledge.
