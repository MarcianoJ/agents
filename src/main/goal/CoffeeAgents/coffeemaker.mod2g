% The coffee machine's main function is to supply a user with nice steaming fresh cups of
% coffee. It knows how to make coffee and espresso. For making coffee it needs grounds
% (see imported coffee.pl). Whenever it needs grounds it will request another machine it
% knows that can provide grounds to provide those (see imported event.mod2g). It will
% learn this by asking all other agents what they can provide. The coffee machine is very
% cooperative and will always provide what other machines need if it has what is requested
% for, or, alternatively, adopt a goal to make what is requested.
