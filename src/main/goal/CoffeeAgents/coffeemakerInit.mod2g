% knows that can provide grounds to provide those (see imported event.mod2g). It will
% learn this by asking all other agents what they can provide. The coffee machine is very
% cooperative and will always provide what other machines need if it has what is requested
% for, or, alternatively, adopt a goal to make what is requested.
