use "Tic-Tac-Toe-1.2.0.jar" as environment with xplayer = "agent",  oplayer = "agent".


define x as agent {
	use tictactoe as main module.
	use events as event module.
	use TTTinit as init module.
}

% duplicate... apparently we don't support launchrules like launch agent:x anymore.
define o as agent {
	use tictactoe as main module.
	use events as event module.
	use TTTinit as init module.
}

launchpolicy {
    when name=xplayer launch x.
    when name=oplayer launch o.
}
